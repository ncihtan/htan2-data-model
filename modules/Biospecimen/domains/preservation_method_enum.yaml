    title: preservation_method
    permissible_values:
      "Cryopreserved":
        description: Preservation of cells, tissues, organs, or embryos by storage at low temperatures.
      "Cytospin Slide":
        description: A microscope slide prepared by depositing cells directly onto a slide by centrifugation. The cytocentrifuge spins at an angle, at low speeds, allowing the cells to adhere to the slide in a monolayer format.
      "Fixation":
        description: The chemical preservation of a substance to maintain structural and/or molecular features of that substance as they exist in the living entity.
      "Fresh":
        description: Tissue which has not been exposed to a fixative solution.
      "Fresh Dissociated":
        description: A tissue preparation process that takes fresh tissue and dissociates it into single cell suspensions.
      "Fresh Dissociated and Single Cell Sorted":
        description: A tissue preparation process that separates fresh dissociated tissue cells into cell populations by single cell sorting.
      "Fresh Dissociated and Single Cell Sorted into Plates":
        description: A tissue preparation process that takes dissociated, sorted cells and distributes them into cell propagation plates.
      "Frozen":
        description: A specimen that has been subjected to and immobilized by severe cold.
      "Not Applicable":
        description: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.
      "Not Reported":
        description: Not provided or available.
      "Refrigerated":
        description: A specimen that has been kept or preserved at a low temperature in a refrigerator.
      "Refrigerated Vacuum Chamber":
        description: A device designed to maintain a vacuum at a below-ambient temperature.
      "Snap Frozen":
        description: To freeze rapidly so as to preserve structure and prevent ice crystal formation.
      "Unknown":
        description: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.
