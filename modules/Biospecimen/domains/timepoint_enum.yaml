          refer to the variety of chemical-based agents employed to treat cancer.  Cancer
          chemotherapy works by arresting or killing the growth and spread of cancer
          cells.  Because cancer cells usually divide much faster than normal cells,
          they are often very sensitive to the inhibitory actions of chemotherapeutic
          agents.  Chemotherapy may also include agents that enhance immune function
          or alter hormonal activity. (NCI04)
