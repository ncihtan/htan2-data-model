    title: preservation_medium
    permissible_values:
      "Desiccant":
        description: A material that absorbs moisture from its surrounding environment.
      "EDTA":
        description: The acid form of edetate, a chelating agent with anti-hypercalcemic and anticoagulant properties. Edetic acid binds calcium and heavy metal ions, forming soluble stable complexes which are readily excreted by the kidneys. This results in a decrease in serum calcium levels. This agent is also used as an anticoagulant for blood specimens and is applied as a treatment of lead poisoning.
      "FFPE":
        description: Refers to samples that have been preserved with formalin and then embedded into a paraffin block for sectioning.
      "Formalin Fixed - Buffered":
        description: The use of buffered formalin for preservation of tissue samples.
      "Formalin Fixed - Unbuffered":
        description: The use of unbuffered formalin for preservation of tissue samples.
      "Formalin Fixed Tissue":
        description: A tissue sample that has been fixed with formalin.
      "Glutaraldehyde":
        description: A water-soluble oily liquid, C5H8O2, containing two aldehyde groups, used as a disinfectant and as a fixative for biological tissues.
      "Isopentane":
        description: An organic, branched-chain alkane with five carbon atoms.
      "Liquid Nitrogen":
        description: Nitrogen in a liquid state, having been super-cooled to about -200 degrees Celsius.
      "Liquid Nitrogen Vapor":
        description: The gaseous state of liquid nitrogen with a temperature of -167 degrees Celsius.
      "Not Applicable":
        description: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.
      "Not Reported":
        description: Not provided or available.
      "OCT":
        description: Optimal Cutting Temperature Compound - A solution of water soluble glycols and resins that provide a specimen support matrix for cryostat sectioning at temperatures of -10 degrees C and below.
      "Paraffin Block":
        description: Tissue that is preserved and embedded in paraffin.
      "RNALater":
        description: Trade name for an aqueous, non-toxic tissue storage reagent that rapidly permeates tissues to stabilize and protect cellular RNA.
      "TRIzol":
        description: A ready-to-use reagent for the isolation of high-quality total RNA or the simultaneous isolation of RNA, DNA, and protein from biological samples. It is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate.
      "Unknown":
        description: Not known, observed, recorded; or reported as unknown by the data contributor.
